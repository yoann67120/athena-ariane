To display today's date using PowerShell's `Write-Host` command, you can use the `Get-Date` cmdlet to retrieve the current date. Here's a simple script that accomplishes this:# Get today's date$todayDate = Get-Date# Display today's dateWrite-Host "Today's date is: $todayDate"This script will retrieve the current date and time using `Get-Date` and then display it using `Write-Host`. If you want to display only the date without the time, you can format the date accordingly:# Get today's date$todayDate = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"# Display today's dateWrite-Host "Today's date is: $todayDate"In this version, the date is formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd" (year-month-day), but you can adjust the format string to your preference based on your regional settings or desired format.
